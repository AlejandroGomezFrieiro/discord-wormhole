# CHANGELOG

## [unreleased]

- Force registration in Wormhole
- Direct messages and non-wormhole errors are preserved
- `info` is sorted by count and is callable in DM
- Announcements are embeds, so they stand out.

## [0.1.0]

_Because we have to start somewhere. This is not important at all._

- Bump discord.py version to 1.4.0
- Check for user home before loading it (#19)
- Feedback on wormhole creation & removal
- Warnings on failed send/edit
