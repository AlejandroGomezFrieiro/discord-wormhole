# Contributing

When working on some feature, make sure you are on the `devel` branch. Pull requests targeting `master` branch won't be accepted.

Issue tracker is mostly just my TODO list, there may not be enough information. Feel free to ask for details if you're not sure what the issue means.

Always test your PR before. Your code should not create more black and flake8 warnings. Use included pre-commit.
