## Principle

The wormholes are connected with beams. Bot can have multiple beams with independent settings. Wormhole can only be registered to one beam.

Users can set their home wormhole. This will allow others to tag them with `((nickname))`. For technical reasons, user can only be registered to one wormhole, meaning that other's won't be able to tag them from wormholes in another beams.
